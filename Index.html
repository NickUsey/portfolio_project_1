            <b>Hello my name is Nicholas Usey, I program as a hobby, and wanted to learn more about webpages, <br> 
            programming, and design. I work as a Catastrophe Claims Adjuster as my career. My hobbies include <br>
            reading, martial arts, working on my car, and spending time with my wife and dog. My hopes for this <br>
            course to gain a better understanding of JavaScript and all that comes within its realm of programming.</b>
